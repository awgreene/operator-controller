# operator-controller
The operator-controller is the central component of Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) v1. It extends Kubernetes with an API through which users can install Operators.

## Description
OLM v1 is the follow-up to [OLM v0](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager). The vision for OLM V1 is discussed in detail in the [OLM V1 Product Requirements Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-vsZ2dAODNfoHb7Nf0fbYeKDF7DUqEzS9HqgeMCvbDs/edit). 

The Operator Controller project consists of four different components, including this one, which are as follows:
* operator-controller
* [deppy](https://github.com/operator-framework/deppy)
* [rukpak](https://github.com/operator-framework/rukpak)
* [catalogd](https://github.com/operator-framework/catalogd)

Ongoing feature development can always be tracked at the [OLM V1 GitHub Project](https://github.com/orgs/operator-framework/projects/8) by looking at `Milestone #` tabs. 

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:
	
```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/operator-controller:tag
```
	
3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/operator-controller:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
Undeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing
If you are interested in getting involved, please see the [CONTRIBUTING.md](TO/Be/Added) for more information.

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster 

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
